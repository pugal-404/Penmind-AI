# Advanced Handwriting Recognition System

This project implements an advanced handwriting recognition system using machine learning techniques. It provides a web interface for users to upload images of handwritten text and receive digitized versions of the content.

## Features

- Image upload for handwritten text recognition
- Real-time text recognition using a CNN-LSTM model
- Export options for recognized text (TXT, DOCX, PDF)
- Responsive web interface built with React
- FastAPI backend for efficient processing
- Dockerized deployment for easy setup
